# Robert's Testing Framework
Robert's Testing Framework, or RTF, is a simple framework for unit testing javascript code in the browser. While multiple such frameworks, with more functionality and a superior developer experience, do exist already, I wanted to make one for didactic purposes. It's main "feature" is that it runs entirely on the browser and does not require node, or a webserver for that matter. The UI is also quite nice.

To use download this repo, put your test modules on the testModules folder, and link them on testResults.html.
Open testResults.html to view the results.

A simple tutorial on how to get started as well as API documentation can be found on the docs folder
